Hello there! In this project, we will try to predict a very imbalanced dataset - Credit Cards Frauds. As it is said in the description of the dataset, the features are transformed by a PCA (Principal Component Analysis, a Dimensionality Reduction technique) and have their names hidden for privacy reasons. We will try to explore some data and apply different classification models to come to the best solution.
